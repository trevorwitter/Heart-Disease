# Predict Patient Heart Disease

Detect heart disease from patient cardiovascular dataset. The objective of this project is to predict the binary class, heart_disease_present, which represents whether or not a patient has heart disease:
- `0` represents no heart disease present
- `1` represents heart disease present

Data provided by [Cleveland Heart Disease Database](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(heart)) via the UCI Machine Learning repository
